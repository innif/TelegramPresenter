# Telegram Presenter
This bot can be used as a presenter in PowerPoint, LibreOffice or any other presentation software. It emulates the press of the left and right arrow keys to switch between the slides.
The bot is written in python with only nine lines of code.

## How to use
To use this bot, you first have to install Python3 along with the librarys mentioned in requirements.txt.
To do that, you can use the command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` in this folder.
You also need to create a new Telegram-bot using the BotFather-Bot. Look [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather) if you don't know how to do that.
